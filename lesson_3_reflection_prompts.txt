Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Ans: to share and collaborate work with others.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Ans: Not all changes in GitHub is acceptable, so manual pull is recommended.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Ans: Fork is like clone but it happens in GitHub from one user's account to other's account. Clone is cloning remote to local or local to local. Branch is creating a another copy of checkout commit and continue to work on that.
